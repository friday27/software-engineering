# software-engineering

A notebook containing everything I learned or found useful as a software engineer

---

## I. Make a plan

- This roadmap [Learn to become a modern backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) gives you a basic idea of what you should know/learn as a backend engineer. They also provide videos and roadmaps for frontend and DevOps.

- The tech lead engineer in my team once said **A professional software engineer should be able to learn new stuff during working hours. It's good that you are willing to spend time out of work to learn, but it's not mandatory. Everyone has a life. If you feel it's hard to find time to learn, you should talk to your line manager.**

## II. Mindset

### PR Review

Think of these questions before you are going to ask for PR review or when you are reviewing others' PRs

- What is the purpose of this change? Is it necessary? Is there another way to do it?
- What could happen if ... goes wrong?
- Refer to this list of [system quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) and think of what the PR creator might not think of

#### [Visual Consistency](https://uxpin.medium.com/web-ui-design-for-the-human-eye-principles-of-visual-consistency-part-2-7b5d8b647602https://uxpin.medium.com/web-ui-design-for-the-human-eye-principles-of-visual-consistency-part-2-7b5d8b647602)

1. Typography - fonts and styles

2. UI elements

3. Color

#### Tips

- Thinking about ****how the UI should look at any given moment****, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs. [link](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)
