# JavaScript

* [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-complete-guide-to-this-in-javascript/) - The `this` reference inside functions can ****be bound to**** different objects depending on where the function is being called.
* JavaScript is **single threaded (one command executing at a time) and has a synchronous** execution model (each line is executed in order the code appears)

### Asynchronous



### Promises

### Iterators

### Generators
