## TODOs

- Read https://medium.com/reloading/javascript-start-up-performance-69200f43b201
- Read https://web.dev/i18n/en/why-speed-matters/

## Basics

- Think about what matters to you
- Don't tune for speed until you've **measured**
- Things to think about while measuring (TODO: create a diagram for measuring and 3 aspects below)
  - **Hardware** - Are we testing performance on fancy MacBook Pros or consumer-grade hardware?
  - **Network** - Are we simulating less-than-perfect network conditions?
  - **Budget** - What is our performance budger?

## Load Performance

_Until the user actually gets the page, there isn't much to optimize._

## Tools
